Disclaimer (of sorts) ---   I did not make any of these models. Also, my obj loader is pretty lame at the moment and chokes
on multiple-part models. Thus, to trick my loader into thinking the models are one piece, I have copied and pasted all the of
position vertices to the top of the file. This seems to allow the files to be loaded. 

"space_ship2.obj" is really the only model this code was meant to work with, the other two are there just for testing out the 
collision boxes (which are functional but not perfect on the largest models).
