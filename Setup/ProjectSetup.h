// Note on framework versioning: When you build a new version you must update "Current Library Version". There is also a "Compatibility Version"
//In Xcode selector your framework target and in build settings search for linking and you will se this setting there.
//We created a build script to bump this version number every time we build.
//Xcode caches the frameworks and uses the cache if possible. That's why you need to change this number.
